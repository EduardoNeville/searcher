## Tips

1. Filters can be placed anywhere in the query
2. Combine multiple filters for precise results
3. Use date ranges for time-bound searches
4. Boolean operators: AND (both terms), OR (either term)
5. Filter values are case-sensitive for usernames
6. File extensions in filetype are case-insensitive

## Date Format

Always use: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-01-15`)
